I would have to say that Software Development chose me.

In the past I tried learning coding on my own, without much luck.  I couldn't get myself in the correct mindset; I had the wrong image of a Software Developer. Too much rigidity, not enough creativity.

About a year ago, a co-worker suggested I look into a coding academy called 'Code Fellows'.  This was the first time I had heard of such a thing..I was interested and impressed with the job guarantee, but it was not financially feasible for me at that time.

Fast forward about 6 months, things were changing.  I was working as an automotive detailer at BMW.  I will not get into all the problems I had with it, but I was generally unsatisfied with the direction of my professional life.  I decided to change things, I looked deeper into coding schools and came across Flatiron School.  Although the long hours everyday for 3-6 months was not feasible for me and my family, a flexible online version was.  I began the Javascript bootcamp prep course and fell in love with it.  This was the first time learning coding that I really enjoyed it.  I could see the light at the end of the tunnel...and that's when I knew this path was for me.

And here I am.

It's been a rocky road full of self-doubt and life's troubles, but I'm here, doing it and so grateful for this opportunity.
