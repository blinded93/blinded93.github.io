When I began this project, I felt quite lost.  I didn't know where to start or even how to start.  I watched the walkthrough videos a couple times each, but still felt intimidated.  

Imposter syndrome was hitting hard.

I began reading 'The Well-Grounded Rubyist' I got from the library.  Though I have not arrived at a point in the book that would actually help me in this project, it has shown me how much I **have** learned.  It gave me enough of a boost in confidence to get over this hump and just start coding.  I tried doing a couple of different small scraping projects.  I still hadn't decided on a final topic, but I was learning and practicing.  When I would hit a wall, I went to Google.  But I continued trying things until I decided on a local library app.  It was one of the suggestions, so I will not pretend it was some unique inspiration that came from my deepest creative depths.  But lately I have reawakened my love of the library and it just clicked.  I didn't go on some long process in making it, I sat down and tried a bunch of sites, finding the most suitable for scraping information.  Once I had that, I just wrote the code.  I had a general idea of what I wanted to do and it did take a few tries to get it working in it's final format.  I found the most difficulty setting it up as a gem, as this was new, self-researched territory.  Overall though, I enjoyed the project and the process through it.

In conclusion, I've learned a lot in the past several months.  Not just Ruby or any other programming concepts, but about myself. Each time I sit down and code, I am reminded of how the thinking skills required can be applied to everyday living. And having this new path to focus on has helped me realize what aspects of my life are most important and given me a new appreciation and respect of it.
