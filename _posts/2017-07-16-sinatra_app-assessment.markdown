After this blog post and a quick demonstration video, I will have finished my second portfolio project through Learn.  I feel very good about this section and the solid foundation I've built with this knowledge.  I must say, I do enjoy working with Sinatra.

There were several rocky points on this path, but overall I feel excellent with the finished product.  I believe that the end result demonstrates my knowledge of the key points of an MVC Sinatra application.  Though I enjoyed this project, I am also glad to be moving on.  I am very excited to get into Rails and Javascript.  I have been dabbling in the latter a little bit in my spare time and am thrilled at the prospects at how it will enhance my future projects.

Wish me luck, Learn blog, I am off to the future.
