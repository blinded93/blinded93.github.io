Project 3 – Done.

I will not say that it was easy.  In fact, it was the most difficult one yet.  

Going into those first few “rails g…..” commands, stubbing out the models and frame of my application, I had no idea how deep I would be in the end.  As I’m writing this, reflecting on the things that I learned and had to teach myself in order to complete this project, my 6 year-old step-daughter walks into the room and demands I get her lunch this instant!

Anyways…

This past year has been both exciting and very difficult.  Exciting in the sense that I’m succeeding in a role I never thought I could or would want to do.  My journey with Flatiron has helped teach me a lot about myself. It has given me an opportunity to learn how to use technology to solve real problems I didn’t know existed.  But then there is the latter; it hasn’t been easy.  Being a full-time husband and father, working part-time and learning to code in all the little spaces in between, I have a lot of responsibilities I never had before, sometimes making things take longer than they otherwise would.

My project, dubbed Household Management, really challenged me to think of all the things a person needs organized to succeed at running a household.  More aptly, to think about the things I need to work on to become a better organized member of my own. Though the role of a household leader has more obligations than other members; paying bills, maintaining cleanliness and functionality and acquiring necessities, knowing that you don’t have to work alone helps to relieve some of that burden.  I found that providing easy ways to delegate tasks and opening the lines of communication help validate other members positions in the household community. When an individual’s needs, concerns and contributions are validated, it tends to make a happier person. And I like happy people.

From the technology standpoint, my project uses the Ruby on Rails framework as the basis for the application.  Bootstrap 4 was responsible for making the slick visual interface. Although I haven’t officially learned Javascript, I taught myself enough to implement Ajax and JQuery to create this almost single page application. (Single page for members, with a separate page for administrators.)
I have a tendency to create minimalist designs, as I believe they are not only more beautiful, but less distracting and overwhelming to most people. Organization is difficult enough in it’s own right, making something easy and pleasing to use will make them want to use it more.

To bring this post to an end, I would like to say that I am proud of myself and my work. For traveling this far on my journey and sticking with it when times are tough.
So many things happen in life that are hard to predict, often times getting in the way of the parts that can be controlled. Coming out on top has been a challenge.
But I love being challenged. I love learning.  I love coding.

I am happy where I am.
