Learning Javascript has been one of the most beneficial experiences to my understanding of programming. That is not to say that I don't enjoy the Ruby language, but learning a second has given a new perspective and understanding of the first.

After finishing the Javascript section, I learned the next project was going to involve adding Javascript/jQuery to my previous Rails project. In short, I already did. I had used the "remote: true" method, so it wouldn't have met the requirements, however one of my goals was to remake my first web app, Esculent Methods, so that is what this project entails.

The first iteration of Esculent Methods was made in the Sinatra Ruby framework. Though I am proud of my work, it was my first project, so left much to be desired.

The basic premise of the app is a recipe sharing platform. A user has recipes and is able to browse/search for other users recipes which can be favorited or shared with friends. There is also a messaging system that is used to send notes between users and is the basis for sharing recipes.

In it's updated form, the back-end is powered by Rails while the front-end uses mostly jQuery to manipulate the DOM, handlebars for HTML templating and handling the ajax responses using Javascript object models in the form of prototype classes. In this iteration of my app, I chose to add both user and recipe photos, controlled by the 'carrierwave' library. The pagination was added using 'pagy' and most design was bootstrap 4, adding in some custom SCSS of my own.

Overall, I really enjoyed this project. I have been feeling very confident about my educational path and look forward to what the future holds!
I can't wait to start the next section and begin my next project!
