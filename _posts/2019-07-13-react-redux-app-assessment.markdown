I have just completeted my final Project for Flatiron School.

I am happy, excited and a little nervous and intimidated.
Once I complete the assessment, my next step will be the job search!

*deep breath*

Excellent! I've got this.

React was really fun to learn and definitely one of my favorited sections.
Redux was a little harder, but after this project, I feel so much more confident with it.

As far as my last project, I decided to create a dice game called Farkle.

The game consists of scoring points rolling six dice, whoever gets to 10,000 first and can retain their lead after one final turn, wins! Your turn is relinquished if a roll does not contain scoring dice (known as a farkle).

On the technology side of things, React was used as the front-end with Redux state management. If a user decides to sign up (authentication and authorization using JWT), creating a new game will save it to the back-end, powered by Rails. Games are saved after points are banked. As the games are saved, they can also be viewed on the gameboard and continued if incomplete.

In conclusion, I am very excited for the future! This is the point I have been working toward for a while now. It has been a long and hard road, but I am ready. :)

Thank you, Flatiron.
